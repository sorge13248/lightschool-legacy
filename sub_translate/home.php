      <h2>Help translate LightSchool</h2>
      <p>
	LightSchool is changing the way teachers teach their students and now we want to expand from Italy to all the world!<br/>
	But that's complicate: the main problem is that we do not speak 189 languages so we need help to translate our site.<br/>
	You can join us, by selecting your language and start translating from other languages.<br/>
	As every translation done made by users for software and apps, it is completely free and you're not gonna be paid for that work. Anyway you will be credited for your work in the credit page on the site you help to translate.
