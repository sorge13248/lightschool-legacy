# [LightSchool](http://www.lightschool.it/ "LightSchool homepage") â€” Your learning mate
LightSchool is a powerful, customizable and very easy to use web app that aims to provide a great way for improving your student and teacher life.

## Backgrounds ##
I made LightSchool on my own when I was 14 during my first year at high school. My goal was to improve the italian school and educational system my embracing the digital revolution. I studied by myself Visual Basic (at 11) and then HTML, CSS, Javascript (and jQuery) and PHP. After some readings, I started building LightSchool.
I got my first working version with databases (MySQL) after a month of testing. I worked on it until march 2016, then I stopped working on it due to studying necessities.
LightSchool had a lot of features such as: notebooks (a.k.a. word processor), sharing (both with students and teachers), a diary where to schedule homeworks, tests and so on, a timetable management system, istant messaging and a class register.
Most of these features still works and LightSchool is still running at http://www.lightschool.it but I'm no longer improving it and fixing bugs.
Because I don't want to see LightSchool vanishing, I decided to make it open source and give the chance to others to improve and keep it alive.
